# MsTeamsAutomation

Issues:
- code duplicity (how to create a driver in a common class without the need to initialize it)
- how to bypass firefox cookies, the allow button did not seem to be part of the actual web page html+css
- could not locate 'textbox' in MS Teams, tried multiple approaches with 'find element by xpath, by ccs selector ... ', ended with a timeout
